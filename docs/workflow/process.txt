🟢 Step 1 – Frontend Setup

Initialized Vite + React project with Tailwind CSS.
Created clean folder structure (components, pages, routes, assets).
Defined all routes: /login, /signup, /admin etc .
Ran npm run dev → Verified Tailwind & routes working.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



✅ step 2 : Backend Setup & User Module
Setup Express server with clean folder structure.
Configured MongodB Compass (later Atlas 
 ## 1 issue "- connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017, connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017

There was a problem connecting to localhost:27017/projectteam) with .env setup.
Added User model, controller, and routes (register, login, profile).
Integrated bcrypt for password hashing & JWT for authentication.
Implemented auth middleware & role-based access (admin vs member).

Problems & Fixes
❌ DB connection error (Atlas URI + whitelist) → ✅ Fixed by whitelisting IP & updating .env.
❌ userId not defined bug → ✅ Fixed by using id from JWT .

Status: User register/login/profile working. JWT auth functional. Data persisting in Atlas.






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ step 3 : Testing & Image Upload Feature

Tested all auth routes in Postman (register/login/profile).
Verified default role assignment (member) & admin invite token flow.
Debugged route/controller issues during Postman tests.
Added /upload-image route with Multer middleware for file uploads.
Served /uploads folder statically in server.js.
Generated proper file URL → req.protocol + '://' + req.get('host') + '/uploads/<filename>'.

Problems & Fixes

❌ Wrong URL returned (http://{req.get('host')}/uploads/...) → ✅ Fixed by including req.protocol.

❌ Images not accessible in browser → ✅ Fixed by app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads')).


Status: Auth + role-based system + image upload fully functional & tested via Postman.
